<p
    style="font-size:20px;">
     The Early Symptoms include:</p>

<ul>

<p
    title="Effects Of Covid-19"

     The virus can lead to 
       <strong>pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock, and death</strong>. 
          If you notice these severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical attention right away:
</p>

<ul>
       <li
           style="font-family:Baskerville Old Face;"><strong><big>
           Trouble breathing or shortness of breath.

           It varies from person to person.

     When you have symptoms, they can be similar to a bad cold or the flu. Your doctor will suspect

       <strong>person to person.</strong>
<br>Most of the time, it spreads when a sick person coughs or sneezes. They can spray droplets as far as 6 feet away. If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can get into your body. Some people who have the virus don't have symptoms, but they can still spread the virus.
<br>You can also get the virus from touching a surface or object the virus is on, then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes.</br>

<p

      The number of people infected by 
        <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong>changes every day.

<h2
       style="text-align:center;"><i><u>
        How do you prevent the Spread?
</h2></i></u>

<p
    style="font-size:20px;">
       If you're in an area where it's spreading, take these steps:
</p>

<p
    style="font-size:20px;"><b>
            1.Wash your hands often with soap and water, or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer.</b> This kills viruses on your hands.
</p></b>

<p
     style="font-size:20px;"><b>
            2.Practice social distancing.</b> Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible. If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
</p>

<p
     style="font-size:20px;"><b>
           3.Don't touch your face.</b> Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours. If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.
</p>

<p
     style="font-size:20px;"><b>
           4.Clean and disinfect.</b> You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that is approved to treat 

<abbr

Wear gloves when you clean, and throw them away when you are done.
</p>

<p
     style="font-size:20px;">
        There is no need to wear a face mask unless your doctor tells you to. You will need one if you have been exposed to

        How do you plan for a Covid-19 outbreak?

     In addition to practicing the prevention tips listed above, you can:
</p>

<ul>
           
<li

<li 
     style="font-family:Baskerville Old Face;"><big><b>
       If you have people at a higher risk, ask their doctor what to do.
</li></big></b>

<li 
     style="font-family:Baskerville Old Face;"><big><b>
      Talk to your neighbours about emergency planning. Join your neighbourhood chat group or website to stay in touch.

<li

<li
    style="font-family:Baskerville Old Face;"><big><b>
      Make an emergency contact list. Include family, friends, neighbours, carpool drivers, doctors, teachers, employers, and the local health department.
</li></big></b>

<li
     style="font-family:Baskerville Old Face;"><big><b>
      Choose a room (or rooms) where you can keep someone who is sick or who is been exposed separate from the rest of you.

       Is there a Vaccine?

<p
    style="font-size:20px;">
     Not yet, but clinical trials are under way in the U.S. and in China to test 
<a 
    href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-19-vaccine;"

</a>
(which was developed by using messenger RNA) would tell your cells to pump out a protein that will kick-start your immune system to fight the virus. It is worked well in animals and is ready to test in humans.
</p>

<h2
     style="text-align:center;"><i><u>
      Testing for Covid-19
</h2></i></u>

<p
     style="font-size:20px;">
     Call your doctor or local health department if you think you’ve been exposed and have symptoms like:
</p>

<ul>
      <li
          style="font-family:Baskerville Old Face;"><big><b>
          Fever of 100 F or higher

       <li

           Trouble breathing</li>
</big></b></ul>

<p
    style="font-size:20px;">
      The test looks for evidence of the virus in your upper respiratory tract. The person giving the test puts a swab up your nose to get a sample from the back of your nose and throat. That sample goes to a lab that looks for viral material. If it’s there, the test is positive. A negative test could mean there is no virus or there wasn’t enough to measure. That can happen early in an infection. It usually takes 24 hours to get results, but the tests must be collected, stored, shipped to a lab, and processed.

<p

     There’s no specific treatment for 
       <strong>COVID-19.</strong> 
         People who get a mild case need care to ease their symptoms, like
          <strong> rest, fluids, and fever control.</strong> 
            You can take over-the-counter medicine for a 
             <strong>sore throat, body aches, and fever.</strong> 
               But don't give <strong>Aspirin</strong> 
                 to children or teens younger than 19.

     <strong>Antibiotics</strong> 
        would not help because they treat bacteria, not viruses. If you hear about people with

         Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s,</a> 
           but we don't know where they come from.

<p
    style="font-size:20px;">
      Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child. In the United States, regular coronaviruses are more common in the fall and winter, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus infection at any time.

<p
    style="font-size:20px;">
     The symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including a 
      <strong>runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever.</strong> 
      In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as a rhinovirus. You treat this kind of coronavirus infection the same way you treat a cold.
